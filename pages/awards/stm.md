##### Summary

I've joined STM CTF with my friends from BAU (Bahcesehir University)
They were unexperienced as much as I do. Firstly there was a qualification
round. Honestly I did not think that I will pass it. So I just got my friends'
permission to write their names in the team.

As you can understand, things went sideways and I was in the top 30 teams which
are allowed to participate in the final round.

After I told my friends (Berke Kocar and Zafer Huzmeli) about the situation,
they were not amused that much because neither of them had an experience or
interest at that time.

Neverthless after convincing them with the prizes and SWAG from the event, we
studied common exploitation methods as well as basic OWASP Top 10 stuff.

Then we went to Ankara, Turkey for the finals...
