##### Summary

We have entered competition with our underwater communications solution, **Diver's Mate**.

Diver's Mate is a product to solve problem of underwater communications.
Standard RF (Radio Frequency) communications are not possible underwater because
of the properties of the water. Especially combined with various minerals and salt,
radio-waves are "attenuated" heavily, yielding few meters of usable range even with
a powerful antenna.

##### Problem

Various solutions exist as of today, but all of them uses acoustic waves like
how dolphins and whales communicate. This works rather okay in the test environments
such as pools but creates a few problems in the large volumes of water.

- Firstly, composition of the water varies in the nature.
  This affects quality of the sound of acoustic systems.
- Secondly, due to density differences, speed of sound differs,
  causing manual calibration and intervention by the user for a fully
  functioning system.
- And acoustic waves travels hundreds of kilometers in the sea, disrupting
  communication and natural-compasses of animals such as dolphins and whales.

##### Solution

Enter light-based communication. This is a basic version of Li-Fi adapted for
photons' behavior underwater.

**In the simple terms, it is mix of a walkie-talkie and a flashlight, with added
water-proof casing and various sensors to keep track of the diver's health.**

The unibody aluminum casing and green light is completely environment friendly
and 100% recyclable.

Also one other trick is you don't need to point light directly at the person
you want to speak. Our tests showed reflection and scatter effects of water
allows multiple divers are able to talk with each other when they're in side-by-side
formation.

- Light is necessary in underwater conditions.
- Light is consumed by sea algea to use it photosyntesis to make oxygen.
- Quality of sound is higher than acoustic products.
- You can see if your equipment is working or not just by looking at it.
- Sound is transmitted completely in analog conversions
  Meaning: information is not lost since we're not converting it to a digital
  format. Also digital data formats also transmittable by adding it on top of
  regular transmission.
