##### Summary

I have been get to know about this CTF on Twitter from various SecNews sources.

I decided to join for fun, it turns out orbital physics are not easy :) Anyway
it was the _best_ CTF I have ever joined. Especially the `netcat`/`telnet`
interfaces, the outputs were also dynamically generated from some seed which
I did not now at the time.

- It was a _must_ to program your way through.
- No person is fast enough to solve any of the questions by hand.

I think everybody enjoyed as much as I do within couple days. Unfortunately at
the time of competition I was also responsible for setting up production Kafka
clusters at [_iyzico_](/pages/work/iyzico.md).

Anyway, I am also suprised that among pros I was able to get into 25%.
